<span style="color: #000000;">This is a second post of a long comming list, I think... Check my <a href="http://turhanoz.com/what-are-you-doing-android/">previous one</a>.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Clean coding is, from my point of view, the ultimate goal for a developper. A goal that could take a life long experience. In that journey, I, sometimes, don't undestand some design choices made by the Android Team regarding their SDK (AOSP &amp; play-services...) that goes against that goal... I have plenty question in my mind while using the SDK, from architecture choices to naming...</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Let's take a simple example regarding the naming convention:</span></strong><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Check this <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html">TileOverlayOptions</a> class as an example : </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">It has various getters such as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#getZIndex()">getZIndex()</a> or <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#getTileProvider()">getTileProvider()</a>. However, its related setters are not setZIndex() nor setTileProvider() as expected, but defined as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#zIndex(float)">zIndex(float zIndex)</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#tileProvider(com.google.android.gms.maps.model.TileProvider)">tileProvider(TileProvider tileProvider)</a>.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Google is so powerfull that it allows itself to break the naming convention of getters/setters.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">These little changes could sound derisory but why breaking standart industry convention ? Is there any meaningfull reason for that ?</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed, <strong>in standard java, methods should be verbs that describe its action</strong>, as <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html">described in the documentation</a> :</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Although a method name can be any legal identifier, code conventions restrict method names. By convention, method names should be a verb in lowercase or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase, followed by adjectives, nouns, etc. In multi-word names, the first letter of each of the second and following words should be capitalized.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000;">Here, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#zIndex(float)">zIndex()</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlayOptions.html#tileProvider(com.google.android.gms.maps.model.TileProvider)">tileProvider() </a>are nouns that does not reflect at a glance what they are supposed to do. Of course we can deduce it, but it requires some -epsilon- extra effort than facing the standard naming rules.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">As a developper, being effective to reach our goal goes through these simple little standard steps. Don't neglect them.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><br style="color: #000000;" /><strong><span style="color: #000000;">What do you think ?</span></strong>

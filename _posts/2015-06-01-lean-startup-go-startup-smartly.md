<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing knowledge is part of my life vision. I have learned from others and learned from experimenting myself too, so passing this to others is the ultimate reward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Few weeks back, I have been kindly asked by the organizers if I could join the <a href="http://www.androiddeveloperdays.com/">AndroidDeveloperDays 2015</a> as a speaker. I did the previous edition (speaking about <a href="http://turhanoz.com/introduction-to-reactive-programming-on-android/">ReactiveProgramming</a>) and was more than happy to participate to this new one. But instead of talking about technical stuff on Android (which is my passion), I wanted to share this time best practices on Startup-ing. The reason why I choosed this topic is the tremendous amount of time that human being is wasting on building <em>"products that nobody wants"</em>. We often forget that our most precious assest in life is our time and our health. Once spent, nobody will give it back to you. So creating a product in condition of extreme uncertainty shouldn't be done by working blindly hard, but by working smartly. This is all the purpose of this presentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, there was a technical issue while recording some talks during AndroidDeveloperDays, and my talk was among the missed one :'( So I can only share with you the slides.
Maybe I'll give this talk once again one day so I'll share the video too.</p>

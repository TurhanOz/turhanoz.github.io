Few days ago, I had the chance to go to one of most amazing Android event in the  Anatolian peninsula : <a href="http://www.androiddeveloperdays.com/">Android Developer Days 2014</a>.

There, I give a 10 min talks to introduce Reactive Programming, especially the RxJava library. The subject is not so easy to explain in few minutes, but I hope you will enjoy it.
